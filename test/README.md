## Launcher Module Testing

The script `module_test.py` serves the purpose of validating the accuracy and correctness of the Launcher Module. It accomplishes this by data, such as MIC and PMKID, from the output of the module, and subsequently creating a YAML file for storing the output. The extracted information within this YAML file can then be accessed and processed by the script `key_hierarchy_calculation.py`, situated in the crypto directory.

Within the `key_hierarchy_calculation.py` script, the system performs key computations, resulting in the generation of essential cryptographic keys, namely the PMK, PTK, and MIC or PMKID. If the calculated MIC or PMKID aligns with the corresponding output, the Launcher Module is working as expected.

### Install packages

```shell
pip install pyserial
pip install serial
pip install PyYaml
```

### Launch the script

```shell
python module_test.py debug
```

Where debug is set so that it knows which file it should store the output. If debug is set for example it will generate pmkid_debug.yaml or mic_debug.yaml in the crypto directory but if prod is set then it will generate pmkid.yaml or mic.yaml

### Instruction Codes

Instruction language that the launcher module can understand. These codes consist of armament codes, directing the module's actions, and a payload containing the mac address of the target. Meanwhile the control codes serve as the directives for the Launcher Module, indicating whether to activate the attack, deactivate it, or simply display the currently selected type of attack.

### Armament Codes

```text
Code:               Name:                   Description:
"01"                Reconnaissance          Scan nearby AP
"02"                PMKID                   Capture PMKID from the AP
"03"                MIC                     Capture MIC from the AP
"04"                Deauth                  Deauthenticate STAs from AP
```

### Control Codes

```text
Code:               Name:                   Description:
"05"                Armament status         Outputs the currently selected armament
"06"                Armament activate       Actives the selected armament
"07"                Armament deactivate     Deactivates the selected armament
"08"                Armament reset          Resets the ESP32
```

For example, an instruction code "02A1B2C3D4E5F6" means that it will use PMKID based attack and the target is A1B2C3D4E5F6 which is the mac address of the target. An instruction code of "01" simply means do a scan, it does not need a target since it will only scan nearby access points.
